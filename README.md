# GPU-Accelerated HMM for Financial Regime Detection

High-performance C++/CUDA implementation of Hidden Markov Models for detecting market regimes in financial time series.

## Overview

This project implements GPU-accelerated Hidden Markov Models based on **Hassan & Sévil (2021)** for financial regime detection. The system provides both CPU baseline and CUDA-optimized implementations of classical HMM algorithms with custom linear algebra operations tailored for numerical stability and performance.

**Key Components:**

- Forward-Backward, Viterbi, and Baum-Welch (EM) algorithms
- Log-space stable computations for numerical robustness
- Custom linear algebra library (matrix operations, Cholesky decomposition)
- Multivariate Gaussian emission models
- CPU and CUDA dual implementation

## Status

**Current:** ✅ CPU implementation complete with full test suite
**In Progress:** 🔄 CUDA kernel development and optimization
**Next:** 📋 Performance benchmarking and cluster deployment
